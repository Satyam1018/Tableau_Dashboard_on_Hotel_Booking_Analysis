Hotel Booking Analysis

Problem Statement:

To create a visualization in Tableau for the hotel booking EDA project, you can start by importing the cleaned dataset and creating several charts to represent the different analyses that were conducted.

Hotel-wise bookings: Create a bar chart to compare the number of bookings for each hotel. Add a filter to enable the user to select the hotel type (city or resort) and add a tooltip to show the total number of bookings for each hotel.

Distribution channel-wise bookings: Create a stacked bar chart to compare the number of bookings from different distribution channels for each hotel. Add a filter to enable the user to select the hotel type (city or resort) and a tooltip to show the total number of bookings from each distribution channel.

Bookings cancellation: Create a donut chart to show the percentage of bookings that were cancelled. Add a filter to enable the user to select the distribution channel and a tooltip to show the cancellation rate for each channel.

Time-wise bookings: Create a line chart to show the trend of bookings over time (year, month, and day). Add a filter to enable the user to select the hotel type (city or resort) and a tooltip to show the total number of bookings for each time period.

Guest-wise analysis: Create several charts to represent the different guest-wise analyses, such as a bar chart to show the top countries of origin, a pie chart to show the distribution of meal choices, a scatter plot to show the correlation between car parking spaces required and booking cancellation rate, and a bar chart to show the contribution of different agents in bookings.

Overall revenue analysis: Create a bar chart to compare the average daily rate for each hotel type. Add a filter to enable the user to select the time period and a tooltip to show the total revenue generated by each hotel type.

By creating these visualizations, the user can gain insights from the data and make informed decisions based on the findings.
